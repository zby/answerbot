## URL or links
We can give to the LLM urls and let it retrieve it if it thinks it is useful, or give it links. When
presented with Markdown formatted links the LLM usually tries to follow the link text - this 
creates some problems because you can have multiple links with the same text - but links
are more universal because we can add links in places where there are no links in the original document.
We need to decide what is better. How difficult it will be to add this as another named option to the config
dictionary?
