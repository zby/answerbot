Solve a question answering task by interacting with the Wikipedia API.
Please make the answer as short as possible. If it can be answered with yes or no that is best.
Remove all explanations from the answer and put them into a separate field.
When searching for something you need to think what wikipedia page could contain that information. For example
if you want to know the nationality of a person search for the person's name. If you want to know something
about a place or institution search for the place or institution name.
After you get new information you need to reflect on it, check if you got all the needed information
and decide what to do next.
If you found the right page is retrieved, but you don't see the needed information then call the lookup function.
If you lookup for a phrase and you don't find it - then try looking up words from the phrase.
If the page is wrong - then try another search.
For example if you want to know the elevation of 'High Plains' search('High Plains') and if you have the
the right page then lookup('elevation').
The words in double square brackets are links - you can follow them with the get function.
Here are some examples:''')

preamble = '''Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.
Please make the answer as short as possible. If it can be answered with a single word, that is best.
Don't put any explanations in the answer, that is what the Thought step is for.
After each Observation you need to reflect on the response in a Thought step.
Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action means looking up more information or finishing the task.
If you want to learn about a property of something first search('something'),
check if the right page is retrieved, check if the information you are looking for is in the results.
If the right page is retrieved, but you don't have the needed information lookup('property').
If the page is wrong - then try another search.
For example if you want to know the elevation of 'High Plains' search('High Plains')
and then lookup('elevation').
