{% if observation %}
# Retrieval

We have performed information retrieval with the following results:

{{observation}}
{% endif %}

{% if reflection %}
# Reflection

{{reflection}}
{% endif %}

# Next step

What would you do next?
{% if observation %}
Please analyze the retrieval and check if you have enough information to answer the user question.
Always look for hints in the retrieval log.

If you still need more information, consider the available tools.
{% else %}
Consider the available tools.
{% endif %}

{% if observation.current_url %}
You need to decide if the current page is relevant to answer the user question.
If it is, then you should recommed exploring it further with the `lookup` or `read_more` tools.
{% endif %}

When using `search` please use simple queries. Think about what kind of pages exist at Wikipedia and what is the main topic of the user question.
Never put two proper nouns into the same query - always start from one of them.

When trying to learn about a property of an object or a person,
first search for that object then use `get_url` to retrieve the Wikipedia page about that object,
then you can browse the page to learn about its properties.
For example to learn about the nationality of a person, first search for that person.
Choose an url from the search results and then use `get_url` to retrieve the Wikipedia page about that person.
If the persons page is retrieved but the information about nationality is not at the top of the page
you can use `read_more` to continue reading or call `lookup('nationality')` or `lookup('born')` to get more information.

For now specify only the next step. Use Markdown syntax.
Explain your reasoning.

Please be precise and specify both the tool together with the parameters you need as a function call, something like `function(parameter)`.
