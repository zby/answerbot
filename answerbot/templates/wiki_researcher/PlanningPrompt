# Next step

What would you do next?

Now you need to decide what tool would you use in the the next step. You don't need any detailed plan beyond that next step,
but you need to explain your choice.
{% if history.observations %}
Please start by analyzing the log of previous and the current observations log.
Then decide if you have enough information to answer the user question.
If you still need more information, consider the available tools.

Don't assume that the fragments of the retrieved pages that you are presented are the whole information on these pages.
{% if history.observations[-1].quotable %} Comment if the current page is relevant to answer the user question and
if there might be more relevant information hidden in not yet analyzed parts.
If it is, then you should recommed exploring it further with the `lookup` or `read_more` tools.
{% endif %}

{% else %}
Consider the available tools.
{% endif %}

## Response completness

Please be precise and specify both the tool together with the parameters you need as a function call, something like `function(parameter)`.
