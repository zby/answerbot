# The European Financial Data Space (EFDS)


  

 **What is the European Financial Data Space (EFDS)?**


According to the European strategy for data (19.2.2020), the European Commission supports the establishment of **nine common European data spaces,** including the Common European financial data space, "to stimulate, through enhanced data sharing, innovation, market transparency, sustainable finance, as well as access to finance for European businesses and a more integrated market." 


According to the Commission, in the financial sector, EU legislation requires financial institutions to disclose a significant amount of data products, transactions and financial results. Moreover, the **revised Payment Services Directive** marks an important step towards open banking, where innovative payment services can be offered to consumers and businesses on the basis of the access to their bank account data. Going forward, **enhancing data sharing** would contribute to stimulating innovation as well as achieving other important policy objectives at EU level.


The Commission further **facilitates access** to public disclosures of financial data or supervisory reporting data, currently mandated by law, for example by promoting the use of common pro-competitive technical standards. This would facilitate more efficient processing of such publicly accessible data to the benefit of a number of other policies of public interest, such as **enhancing access to finance for European businesses** through more integrated capital markets, improving market transparency and supporting sustainable finance in the EU. 


  

 **What is the European Data Space?**


The EU creates an attractive policy environment so that, by 2030, the EUâs share of the data economy â data stored, processed and put to valuable use in Europe - at least corresponds to its economic weight. **The aim is to create a single European data space** â a genuine single market for data, open to data from across the world â where personal as well as non-personal data, including sensitive business data, are secure and businesses also have easy access to an almost infinite amount of high-quality industrial data, boosting growth and creating value, while minimising the human carbon and environmental footprint. 


It will be a space where EU law can be enforced effectively, and where all data-driven products and services comply with the relevant norms of the EUâs single market. To this end, the EU combines fit-for-purpose **legislation and governance** to ensure availability of data, with investments in standards, tools and infrastructures as well as competences for handling data. 


While data is essential for all sectors of the economy and society, each domain has its own specificities and not all sectors are moving at the same speed. Therefore, **cross-sectoral** actions towards a European data space need to be accompanied by the development of **sectoral** data spaces in strategic areas such as manufacturing, agriculture, health, and finance.

 **Understanding the European Financial Data Space (EFDS)**


Data has always been at the core of financial services and data-driven finance necessitates the
use of varied datasets, such as **publicly and privately held personal and non-personal data.**


Financial data includes publicly disclosed company information and business registry data,
as well as data reported by financial institutions to supervisory authorities. 


Financial data also
relates to data about individual savings, mortgages, consumer credit, investments, pensions
and insurance. Furthermore, innovation in finance **also increasingly relies on non-financial
data.** Therefore, to ensure interoperability, the European financial data space needs to be
developed in close connection with data spaces in other sectors.


The European financial data space includes **three main components.**


**First,** digital access to publicly disclosed financial and sustainability related information. As part of its Capital Markets Union Action Plan, the Commission proposed, in November 2021, a regulation to set up a **European Single Access Point (ESAP),** which will be
established by the **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).** 


The ESAP will be a
common source of free public information about EU companies and investment products,
regardless of where in the EU they are located or originated. It will **interconnect various
sources** of publicly disclosed information. ESAP is expected to be operational from 2024 and
will be gradually developed in a phased-in approach. In parallel with the ESAP regulation, the
Commission has proposed amendments to EU financial services legislation requiring public
disclosures to be made systematically available on ESAP and in a data extractable or
machine-readable formats. ESAP will in that way **contribute to the creation of the European
financial data space** and facilitate data sharing among various stakeholders. 


It is expected that
the availability of such high-value data will strengthen the use of technologies like **artificial
intelligence, machine-learning and natural-language processing** in the near future. In addition,
synergies with other initiatives are expected. Starting from 2022, the set-up of the ESAP
will also be supported under DIGITAL, as announced in the DIGITAL Work Programme
2021-2022.


**Second,** easier reporting and sharing of **supervisory data** among EU and national supervisory
authorities. The Commission has adopted a supervisory data strategy which aims to streamline
EU-level supervisory reporting and facilitate data sharing between supervisory authorities at
EU and national level, as well as making more information available to the industry. 


The
strategy envisages the development of a **common data dictionary** to ensure consistency and
standardisation across the financial sector, making it easier to share and reuse data, and
contributing to making reporting requirements machine-readable and executable. In addition,
the Commission will continue the work in cooperation with the ESAP, in particular during the
development of the technical standards for the ESAP. 


The supervisory data strategy will help
enable the use of innovative technologies, including **regulatory technology (RegTech)** tools
for supervisory reporting by regulated entities and **supervisory technology (SupTech)** tools for
supervision by authorities. The strategy was adopted in November 2021.


**Third,** the **business-to-business and business-to-consumer data sharing and reuse in the EU financial sector (open finance).** The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) led the way in opening up data sharing on payments accounts. Further steps towards enhanced
data sharing and openness across and within the various types of financial services will enable
the financial sector to fully embrace data-driven innovation, in full compliance with personal
data protection and competition rules. 


To ensure maximum coherence and synergies among these three elements of the European
financial data space, the Commission will aim to use **common governance structures** to the
extent possible. The objective is to help integrate European capital markets, channel
investments into sustainable activities, support innovation and bring efficiencies for
consumers, businesses and authorities alike.

 **The expert group on European financial data space** 


 The Commission Expert Group on European Finance Data Space was set up in 2021 to provide advice on the technical aspects of establishing a common financial data space. 


The common financial data space is the third priority area of the **Digital Finance Strategy** which aims to promote data-driven innovation in finance. 


The group will provide advice and expertise to the **DG Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union (FISMA)** in relation to the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives in the field of data sharing in the financial sector, to further the establishment of a common financial data space in the EU. 


The group will also need to assess the need for any **interaction with other data spaces and data-sharing** beyond the financial sector. 


As part of its deliberations, the group would also be expected to look into the relevant policy issues associated with such data-sharing, including data confidentiality, privacy, customer consent and potential impact on access to financial services and products, taking into account the ongoing work on the **Data Act.**


According to the **Report on Open Finance,**  from the Expert Group on European financial data space, **open finance** refers to the sharing, access and reuse of personal and non-personal data for the purposes of providing a wide range of financial services. 


 The **objective** of open finance is to
promote innovative financial products and services to the direct benefit of consumers and
firms. 


A **key condition** for open finance is strong consumer trust and confidence. 


Further steps towards enhanced data openness across and within sectors will increase opportunities for data-driven innovation and support the creation of a broader single market for data.


To achieve its objective, open finance can only work based on strong customer trust and confidence in the sharing and reuse of data â including personal data. In this respect, a **condition for open finance** is to protect consumers and firms by **addressing risks** related to data access and use and reducing use issues, e.g.:


**Risks related to consumers and firms** â risks related to unfair use of data, mis-selling,
fraud or a lack of expected protection from a service or product due to incorrect advice
or incomplete information;


**Exclusion risks** - risks related to exclusion, discrimination or overcharging because of a
customerâs risk profile;


**Operational risks** â risks related to complex data control & management because of
increasing data sharing and reuse; cybersecurity risks that could affect the customer,
the data holder, or the underlying open finance infrastructure; Including with regards to
the protection of personal and non-personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property
theft or **industrial espionage.**

 **Acts related to the European Financial Data Space (EFDS)**


**The Data Governance Act**


The first instrument announced in the data strategy, the Data Governance Act (DGA), entered into force on 23 June 2022 and is applicable since 24 September 2023. The DGA strengthens trust in data sharing by regulating organisations that bring the demand and supply sides of the data market together. The Regulation is a **key building block** for the common European data
spaces.


The DGA facilitates the development of common European data spaces through several mechanisms:


1. Recognised **data altruism organisations** support the emergence of sufficiently-sized data pools made available on the basis of data altruism in order to enable data analytics and
machine learning, including across the Union.


2. **Data intermediation services** support the bilateral or multilateral sharing of data or the
creation of platforms or databases enabling the sharing or joint use of data, as well as the
establishment of specific infrastructure to connect data subjects and data holders with data
users. As orchestrators of data-sharing ecosystems, data intermediaries open the market in
the context of common European data spaces.


3. To help potential re-users find relevant information on what data is held by which public
authorities, Member States are required to make a safe reuse of specific categories of **public
sector data** possible. This is facilitated through the European register for protected data
held by the public sector, available at data.europa.eu â the official portal for European
data. This complements the 2019 Open Data Directive, which does not cover the types
of public sector data addressed by the DGA. 


**The European Data Innovation Board (EDIB),** also established under the DGA, acts as an
advisory body to the European Commission for all matters related to the implementation of the DGA and
for horizontal issues pertaining to the common European data spaces. 


It consists of Member
State representatives from the competent authorities for data intermediation services and for the
registration of data altruism organisations, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the SME envoys network, and other representatives of relevant bodies in
specific sectors, as well as bodies with specific expertise.

**The Data Act**


The Data Act was proposed in February 2022 and entered into force on 11 January 2024. It applies from 12 September 2025. As the second key legislative initiative announced in the European data strategy, the Data Act **complements the Data Governance Act** by clarifying access and use rights on data with the objective of ensuring fairness in the data economy.


 The main aim of the Data Act is to **remove barriers to the access to high-quality data,** particularly in the industrial context (currently 80% of this data is not used). It facilitates data sharing both in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) situations while ensuring that data protection rules are respected when personal data is shared. 


 The Data Act is an ambitious measure aiming to facilitate the development of new products and services leveraging on Europeâs wealth of data. It does so by **clarifying the rights and obligations** of the different parties involved in the use of data from connected products, notably clarifying that lawful users of such products have full access and usage rights, as well as rights to control use by others.


Furthermore, it establishes a mechanism by which **public sector bodies can request data** from a business where there is an exceptional need and provides clear rules on how such requests
should be made. An exceptional need can be, but is not limited to, a public emergency such as
a pandemic or earthquake. It also includes measures to protect SMEs from unfair contractual
terms imposed by stronger players and to increase the competitiveness of the European cloud
market by removing legal, technical and financial obstacles to effective switching between
cloud service providers.


In addition, the Data Act introduces **safeguards** on transferring non-personal data **beyond the
EU borders at the request of a third country government** where that would create a conflict with
Union law or the national law of the relevant Member State, or in exceptional cases where a
data holder is highly likely to suffer serious economic damage from the disclosure of trade
secrets.


Finally, it defines essential requirements regarding the **interoperability of data spaces,** and sets
out interoperability provisions for providers of data processing services.

**The Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act**


**The Digital Markets Act (DMA)** entered into force on 1 November 2022 and its implementing
regulation was adopted on 14 April 2023, in view of the applicability of the DMA from 2 May
2023. The DMA applies to **large digital platforms acting as important gateways** for business
users to reach consumers. The objective of this legislation is to ensure contestable and fair
markets in the digital sector and to enable other companies to access these markets and compete
on a balanced, even field.


There is a strong focus on **data access and use** in the DMA. For example, it introduces an
obligation for gatekeepers not to use data they collected from the business users of their
platforms to compete with those business users as well as an obligation not to combine personal
data of consumers from two or more of their core platform services without consent in
accordance with the GDPR.


**The Digital Services Act (DSA)** was presented as a complementary measure to the DMA,
covering online content moderation, clarifying **responsibilities and obligations of online
intermediary services, hosting services and large online platforms.** The DSA aims to increase
democratic control and transparency of online content, in particular **harmful content.** More
specifically, the DSA introduces a new transparency regime which will ensure access, under specific conditions, to data collected by very large online platforms with tens of millions of
users in the European Union.


The DSA came into force in November 2022 after a long negotiation and intense discussion
with industry representatives and civil society associations. It is applicable since July 2023 for
very large platforms and from January 2024 for all other actors. An essential aspect of
compliance is the **establishment of a risk management system to identify and mitigate** potential
risks for society, like harmful content. In February 2024, EU Members had to appoint Digital Services Coordinators who oversee compliance.
