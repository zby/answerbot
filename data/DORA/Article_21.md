The joint report shall explore ways to facilitate the flow of ICT-related incident reporting, reduce associated costs and underpin thematic analyses with a view to enhancing supervisory convergence.

  


2\. The joint report referred to in paragraph 1 shall comprise at least the following elements:

(a) prerequisites for the establishment of a single EU Hub;

(b) benefits, limitations and risks, including risks associated with the high concentration of sensitive information;

(c) the necessary capability to ensure interoperability with regard to other relevant reporting schemes;

(d) elements of operational management;

(e) conditions of membership;

(f) technical arrangements for financial entities and national competent authorities to access the single EU Hub;

(g) a preliminary assessment of financial costs incurred by setting-up the operational platform supporting the single EU Hub, including the requisite expertise.

  


3\. The ESAs shall submit the report referred to in paragraph 1 to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission by 17 January 2025.
