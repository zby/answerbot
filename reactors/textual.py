system_prompt = '''
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types:
(1) Search[entity], which searches the entity in wikipedia, it saves it for looking up parts of it and presents the beginning of it.
(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the text surrounding the keyword in the current wikipedia page.
(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
Each of your answers must contain an Action, and may contain multiple Thoughts. It must not contain Observations.

Observation: == Description == The Colorado orogen, formerly called the Colorado province, is a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock (1.78–1.65 Ga) that extends southward into New Mexico and composes a major part of the Proterozoic provinces of southwestern United States. This transcontinental collisional event occurred during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). The Wyoming sector of the Colorado orogeny was formerly called the Medicine Bow orogeny. The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny. The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the Wyoming craton is the Cheyenne belt, a 5-km-wide mylonitic shear zone that verges northward. The Cheyenne belt transects and cuts off the south edge of the older Trans-Hudson orogeny.""" },

The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.
