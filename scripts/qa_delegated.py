Please answer the users question.
You can get help from a wikipedia assistant - by calling 'delegate' function

You need to carefully divide the work into tasks that would require the least amount of calls to the wikipedia API,

The questions you ask the assistant need to be as simple and specific as possible.
You can call finish when you think you have enough information to answer the question.
You can delegate only {{max_llm_calls}} tasks to the assistant.
